# Open Questions

Running log of unresolved questions across all study sections.

## Section 01 — Product Overview & Positioning

- How does the LangGraph-compatible API surface (`/api/langgraph/*`) map internally? Is it thin nginx routing, or does the Gateway implement the LangGraph HTTP protocol itself?
- What exactly does the provisioner container do? The README implies Kubernetes sandbox pod scheduling — what RPC protocol connects Gateway → provisioner?
- v1 Deep Research architecture: what was its LangGraph graph structure? Knowing the baseline clarifies what v2 replaced.
- `DEER_FLOW_PROJECT_ROOT` vs `DEER_FLOW_HOME` — why two separate env vars? One for config, one for runtime state?
- How does LangGraph's concept of "assistant" (`assistant_id: lead_agent`) map to DeerFlow's internal agent model?

## Section 02 — System Architecture (Runtime Package)

- `converters.py` is not re-exported from `__init__.py` and not used by `RunJournal` (which calls `model_dump()` directly). Is it dead code, or consumed by something outside this folder?
- `make_stream_bridge` has a `"redis"` branch that raises `NotImplementedError("Redis stream bridge planned for Phase 2")`. Is this actively on the roadmap?
- `DbRunEventStore` uses PostgreSQL advisory locks for monotonic `seq` assignment. Is there a concurrent-write test verifying this guarantee?
- `JsonlRunEventStore.list_messages()` scans all run files per thread (O(runs)) while `list_events()` reads one file (O(1)). Is this a performance concern at scale?
- `run_events_config.track_token_usage` flag: which config key controls it, and is there a documented rationale for ever disabling it?
